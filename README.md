## Installation
The installations for the project are MySQL2, Sequelize, dotenv, express as well as node.js.

## Usage
In order to start the e-commerce process, you must first put in the information of the database name, username and password to your MySQL into a environment variable. You may then source your schema.sql as well as seed your database by typing in 'npm run seed'. Next you will type in 'node server.js' into your command line in order to listen on your port. I personally used Insomnia to test my routes.
